<h3>Geometry Clipping</h3>

<p>Your geometry has been clipped to match the territorial sea boundaries. Portions not overlapping the territorial sea, or overlapping land, have been removed.</p>
<p>If you ever need to change your shape, we also keep a copy of the lines you draw, so you will always have the un-clipped version for editing.</p>
